# LUTS
Here are some of my LUT. These are technical LUTs, not looks.

## Whitebalance LUTs
### WB_Temperature_V3.cube
This LUT removes the tint component from an image and extremely accentuated the blue and yellow saturation. You can use this so see the temperature of different parts of the image. Only parts which are perfect neutral will be grey, all other parts will be extremely yellow or blue.

### WB_Tint_V3.cube
This is the same as WB_Temperature_V3.cube but the temperature component is deactivated and the tint is accentuated.
